# Vault To Blog
A Community Plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) to publish your vault or directory to GitHub Pages Blog.   
> This plugin is currently in beta, so it only offers a limited set of features at the moment.

> This plugin may not work properly on Windows. I have only tested it on a Mac.

## Prerequisites
- Create a GitHub Repository   
  - You need to first create a GitHub repository that will be used for GitHub Pages.
  - The name of repository should be `<username>.github.io`. 
  - For more detailed information, please refer to point 3 in [this documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).
- Set GitHub Pages to Use GitHub Actions   
  - In the repositoryâ€™s settings, go to Pages and set the Build and deployment source to GitHub Actions.   
  - For more detailed information, please refer to [GitHub Pages Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow).
- Public Repository Required   
  - The repository used for GitHub Pages must be set to public.
  - Private repositories are not currently supported.
- No Custom Domain Support   
  - Custom domains are not supported at this time. 
  - Please use the default GitHub Pages URL provided by GitHub.

  - For more detailed information, please refer [GitHub Authentication Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github#authenticating-with-the-command-line).
  - If you are using SSH, you should use SSH URL of the repository.

## Usage
1. Enable plugin in the settings menu.
2. Select the directory you want to publish as a blog from the list, then click the Save button.
